# Hand-over — 2026-11-06 (evening)

What is open, what is already known, and where the evidence is. Written for
whoever picks this up next; every claim below was measured or read, and the
file and line that settles each one is named.

State at hand-over: **`scripts/quality.sh` is green** on `e5ad552` — lint clean,
2 311 tests (19 properties), CRAP worst 29.85 against a threshold of 20. CI's
last completed run (`42254886887`, on `4d92066`) was **red in two jobs**, both
fixed by `e5ad552`: `lint` (one unformatted test file) and `types` (a real bug
dialyzer found — the generator's "map unchanged" guard compared a binary with a
`File.read/1` result, so it never fired and every `mix test` rewrote the map).
Check CI on the commit after this one before believing anything in section 10.

What is left, in order:

1. **Training makes fewer objects than Monty does** — the chart the user
   noticed: Monty's training built three graphs, ours two, from the same six
   training episodes (section 10.4). This is the first thing to look at.
2. **`GraphLM` + `DisplacementGraphLM`** — the keystone port, 62 experiments
   (section 10.6). Must land as a pair.
3. **Two decisions still with the user** (10.7): Monty's pytest fixtures in the
   catalogue, and whether Habitat-Sim stays a permanent refusal.
4. **Performance** (7) is unchanged and still the biggest single win left.
5. The deferred review of the colocated CSS/JS/hooks, which is written down in
   the repository memory, not here.

## 1. CI: the macOS leg was a runner label, not an entitlement — **closed**

`6bd0bfe` changed the desktop matrix's `os: macos-14` to `os: macos-latest` in
`.github/workflows/ci.yml:648`, and run `42178863188` came back **green in every
job**, `desktop (ex-tbp-monty-osx-arm64): success` included. So the annotation
`The configuration 'macos-14-arm64-us-default' is not supported` was the label
and nothing else; the earlier "account entitlement" reading (in `docs/desktop.md`
and commit `93397d4`) was wrong and `3f94618` has the correction.

## 2. No tagged release exists, so "latest binary" means the nightly artifact

`gh release list` is empty and `desktop release` only runs on `v*` tags, so it is
skipped on every `main` run — that is the one line to expect in a green run. The
README's three download links and `scripts/run-desktop.sh` / `run-desktop.ps1`
all go through `nightly.link/.../workflows/ci/main/<asset>.zip`, which serves
the newest `ci` artifacts from `main`; all three returned **HTTP 200** when
checked (osx-arm64, linux-x64, win-x64). Nothing is broken — but a versioned
"latest release" page does not exist. A `v*` tag is what creates it.

## 3. A crashed step left no sentence on the run — **closed, and the diagnosis was one process too far**

Symptom: the run page said _"This run did not finish. It stopped without saying
why."_ — `Failure.explain(nil)`, the record has no `reason` at all. The
statistics sat beside it: the desktop database's
`4b2d9d31-0d2d-44ce-9511-7a496fcd760c` is `failed` with `steps_done: 2383`,
`episodes_done: 22` and a summary of every number **but** a reason.

The crash itself, reproduced headlessly on `base_10simobj_surf_agent` — same
stack trace as the studio run that reported it:

```
** (RuntimeError) an undo jump left the agent turned away from where it started
    informed_policy.ex:369  assert_undo_jump_was_successful/2   (raise)
    informed_policy.ex:211  jump_outcome/3
    informed_policy.ex:194  goal_driven_actions/4
    surface_policy.ex:201   surface_step/6
    step.ex:222             Step.handle_call/3
```

**The earlier reading of this was wrong, and the wrong part is worth keeping.**
This section used to say the crash happened "between calls" with nobody watching,
and that the step coordinator should therefore write to `RunHistory` itself. It
does not: a coordinator computes only during a call, and the caller — the Oban
worker — was inside `GenServer.call`, so it was handed the exit, `step_once`'s
`catch` turned it into `{:crashed, step, reason}`, and
`Monty.Frameworks.Experiments.MontyExperiment` carried it up. The reason _was_
known. `close/6` then finished the record with `RunLog.summary/1`, which returns
the numbers and has no field for a reason — so the one thing the run knew was the
one thing the record did not keep.

**The change** (in the order it happens):

1. `Monty.Runtime.Model.step/4` unwraps a coordinator's death: what
   `GenServer.call` raises is `{{exception, traceback}, {GenServer, :call, _}}`,
   and that is re-raised as the exception with the step's own traceback — the
   frame that actually failed. A model that is not running stays an exit.
2. `Monty.Studio.Jobs.Run.step_once/3` builds `Failure.crashed(kind, reason,
__STACKTRACE__)` in its `catch`, **where the traceback still exists** — a
   reason formatted later from a bare term has none.
3. `Monty.Studio.Failure.stopped/1` is what a crash becomes however it arrives: a
   pair already built, an exception, a sentence, or a term (which is the detail,
   never the answer). `{:target_not_visible, id}` gets its own sentence.
4. `RunLog.summary/2` merges that pair into the summary, and `close/6` passes it
   whenever the outcome is `{:crashed, …}`. A record that says `failed` now says
   why, in the same row a page reads.

**Not done, on purpose**: no `RunHistory` call was added under `lib/monty/runtime/`.
The coordinator owns processes and routing; the studio owns records. A crash
reaches the database through the caller, which is the only process that knows
which run it was stepping.

**Still open in the same family** — recorded so it is not mistaken for fixed:
`mix monty.run` has its own episode loop and no `catch`, so a raise there leaves
the record `running` until a page reaps it, with the Reaper's truthful but
uninformative "it stopped before it finished — nothing was working on it any
more". The task does exit 1 (reproduced), so a script sees the failure.

## 4. The raise itself: the assertion was too strict here — **closed**

> `InformedPolicy.assert_undo_jump_was_successful/2` raising on
> `base_10simobj_surf_agent` is either a real bug or an assertion too strict.

It is the second, and the number settles it. Monty compares the quaternions it
_stored_ — `np.all(state[agent].rotation == self._pre_jump_state.rotation)`, exact
equality — so it compares one value with itself. An agent's rotation here is
rebuilt from the world's answer by normalising the quaternion the world reports
(`Rotation.from_quaternion/1`), so a pose put back exactly still comes back
**1.1e-16** away; `Rotation.to_quaternion/1` followed by
`Rotation.from_quaternion/1` measures that directly. The comparison is now an
angle — a thousandth of a degree counts as where it started — and the raise says
how far the agent was turned, so the next reader has the number in the sentence
instead of having to reproduce the run. It is
`docs/monty-differences.md` §2.19.

**How it was proved.** Two policy tests (a rotation that came back a last bit
away is where it started; a five-degree turn raises and says "by 5.0 degrees");
then the config itself — `mix monty.run base_10simobj_surf_agent --no-record`
**finished all 140 episodes, every one ending in `match`: 22 842 steps in 437 s
(19 ms a step), exit 0, and not one undo-jump raise** — where the old code died
at the tenth recognition. The acceptance ladder is unchanged digit for digit:
`0.746 (192, 6)` … `6.338 (1429, 2)`, `goals 15065` under `MIX_ENV=test`, and
`0.908 (802, 4)` … `11.712 (2342, 1)`, `goals 15328` in dev.

## 5. The experiment page's run list — **answered; the query was sound**

The two candidates were a name mismatch and `search/1` reading a column the light
row no longer selects. The query settles both, against the database the report
came from: the desktop SQLite file
(`~/Library/Application Support/ex-tbp-monty/ex_tbp_monty.db`) has **two** rows
for `base_10simobj_surf_agent`, and the page's own predicate finds both —
`lower(experiment) LIKE lower('%base_10simobj_surf_agent%')` matches, and
`search(state: "all", text: name)` returns them (checked). So the list was not
"finding nothing": the page whose screenshot showed "No run of this experiment
yet" was showing a database without runs of that experiment — the dev Postgres
holds only `base_config_10distinctobj_dist_agent` (two finished runs).

What _was_ wrong is smaller, and is fixed: `recent_runs/1` read twenty-five rows
to keep five and then filtered them in Elixir, so an experiment whose name is the
beginning of a busier one's could show nothing at all. It is
`RunHistory.list_for(name, limit: @runs_shown)` now — the exact name in the SQL,
five rows read.

## 6. The desktop sidecar failed every log write before succeeding — **closed**

Every line in the desktop window's console was preceded by
`Failed to write log message to stdout, trying stderr`, so the console doubled
every line and buried the real ones.

The message is OTP's own: `logger_std_h:write_to_dev/2` writes the console handler
through the `user` process, and its first clause catches and apologises before
falling back to stderr. A sidecar has no console, so it failed on every line.
`config/desktop.exs` now creates the default handler with
`config: %{type: :standard_error}`, which takes the `standard_error` clause and
cannot fail that way; the window drains both streams
(`src-tauri/src/main.rs:388-453`), so nothing leaves its console.

Proved on a throwaway database
(`SQLITE_PATH=/tmp/deskdb.sqlite MIX_ENV=desktop`): the handler reads
`type: :standard_error`, a `Logger.info/1` line lands on stderr and not on
stdout, and "Failed to write log message" appears nowhere. (The window's own
console was not opened for this; the stream is the property that changed.)

## 7. Performance: what is left, and how to measure it here

Current: **6.85 M reductions/step**, 79 MB of garbage, ~42.5 ms/step on a quiet
box, 140/140 episodes. Two changes this session: decode as 32-bit halves
(`e00e058`, −3 %) and `node_poses/4` reading pose vectors by shape instead of
`Enum.take` + `Enum.slice` (`fc0a063`, −10.5 %). Both ladder-identical.

- **Read the profile for call counts and words allocated only.** `tprof`'s time
  column is inflated ~16× by its own tracing (`scripts/probe_tprof_overhead.exs`:
  24.6 ms by the clock vs 402.7 ms reported for the same loop). Its `callers`
  report does not exist in tools 4.2.3 (`:tprof.inspect/3` has no clause), so a
  `pattern`-filtered profile gives counts but no call graph.
- **Never compare wall clock across machines or loads.** An earlier "823 ms/step,
  21× Monty" was measured at load average 10.6–14.7 and is withdrawn in
  `docs/speed.md`; the same steps run at 12–170 ms on an idle box.
- **What the counts say now**: 26 015 `Enum.map/2` calls averaging ~12 elements
  (306 k iterations), 9 681 `Enum.take/2` before `fc0a063`, per-hypothesis
  closures (`spread_against`, `gather`, `keep_where`) about 2× per hypothesis.
  `Hypotheses.gather/3`, `poses`/`locations`, and the displacer's hot path are
  **already** binaries and kernels — do not "optimise" them again.
- **The "next target" this note used to name was a phantom.** It said
  `SpatialArithmetics.check_orthonormal/1` (`spatial_arithmetics.ex:182`) does a
  per-hypothesis `mᵀ·m` in the hot loop, on the strength of 12 976
  `Geometry.transpose/1` and 5 129 `Geometry.mul/2` calls in one step. The
  function has **no production caller** — `grep -rn check_orthonormal lib/` finds
  its definition and nothing else, and only
  `spatial_arithmetics_test.exs:192` calls it. The counts belong to the
  `align_orthonormal_vectors*` family (`:218`, `:340`, `:468`), `Cmp.Message`'s
  rotation (`message.ex:187`) and `EvidenceGraphLM`'s pose comparison
  (`evidence_graph_lm.ex:1260`, `:1441`, `:1605`). This is the trap the memory
  warns about: a call count read off a profile was attributed to a neighbouring
  function in the same module, and "optimising" it would have changed nothing.
  If a cheap win is wanted, measure first and name the _caller_
  (`MIX_ENV=test mix run scripts/probe_step_cost.exs` for the step's cost), then
  run the ladder — `mix monty.run base_config_10distinctobj_dist_agent
--episodes 1 --steps 8 --no-record` — which must stay digit for digit:
  `0.746 (192, 6)` … `6.338 (1429, 2)`, `goals 15065` under `MIX_ENV=test`.

## 8. Standing rules this codebase is held to

- `scripts/quality.sh` is the gate (lint, suite with coverage, CRAP); `mix
dialyzer` is the separate types job. `scripts/reformat.sh` formats.
- Module for module: Python `a/b.py::C` is `Monty.A.B.C`; `mix
monty.module_map.verify` enforces it. Never rename a mapped module.
- Functional core, actor shell: only `Monty.Runtime.*` owns processes.
- Kernel changes keep the Elixir reference path and a parity test; the ladder's
  eight evidence lines are the acceptance.
- Tests specify behaviour, no `Process.sleep/1`, no casting an interface to a
  concrete type to reach test helpers.

## 9. Closed this session (so nobody re-opens them)

- **Dependabot #1, `glib` (Rust, medium)**: dismissed as a tolerable risk with
  the verified chain — `tauri 2.12.5` pins `gtk = "^0.18"`, `gtk 0.18.2` needs
  `glib = "^0.18"`, and `cargo update -p glib --precise 0.20.0 --dry-run`
  refuses with exactly that. Linux-target only; clears when tauri adopts
  gtk 0.19+ (needs glib ^0.22). Editing a dismissed alert needs a reopen first
  (`409` otherwise).
- **The README's download links**: they exist (three platforms, via
  `nightly.link`), and all three resolve.
- **The two screenshots** the README shows were never committed; they are now
  (`9e4b296`).
- **The full experiment completing** — twice, with identical step and goal
  counts (4 789 steps, 4 558 928 goals), once at load 10.6–14.7 and once quiet.

## 10. This session: the map became tooling, the table became a page, the runner learned

### 10.1 What landed, in order

| commit    | what it changes                                                                                                                                                                 |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `d8590c5` | `mix monty.run` carries the memory between episodes and walks each phase's own objects (it started every episode from the eval list and learned nothing)                        |
| `f0fbb3b` | the module map carries `stand_in:` (19 classes) and `file:` (176), `Setup`'s findings read one table instead of keeping two lists, and `mix test` refreshes the map best-effort |
| `91a3226` | `/modules` — the generated map as a filterable table                                                                                                                            |
| `9025e2f` | each row links the file _and_ the test beside it, on both sides, by scheme                                                                                                      |
| `4d92066` | the evidence chart draws the zero line (`Chart.zero`)                                                                                                                           |
| `e87eb53` | the same on the run page (`Replay.Chart.zero`)                                                                                                                                  |
| `e5ad552` | the map's "unchanged" guard actually fires; the lint formatting CI asked for                                                                                                    |

### 10.2 The module map is tooling now, not a document

`lib/monty/module_map/data.ex` is generated and the generator keeps it true:
`mix test` runs `monty.module_map.gen --best-effort` first, so a machine with the
checkouts beside it refreshes the map before the suite, and a machine without
them — CI has neither — keeps the committed map and says so. A package with no
checkout keeps its entries _and_ its recorded commit; an unchanged map is not
rewritten (mtime is what makes Mix recompile it); the write goes beside the file
and is renamed onto it, because `mix test --partitions 4` can start four at once.

Two facts are now in the map that a page cannot invent: `stand_in:` and `file:`.
The first is written down once, in `Monty.ModuleMap.StandIns` — the two shells
(`Monty`, `MontyForGraphMatching` → `Monty.Runtime.Model` + `Monty.Runtime.Step`)
and the 17 MuJoCo classes the carried world in `priv/monty_py/world.py`
implements — and `verify` fails if a declared stand-in names a module that is not
there. The second is asked of the compiled module's own `compile_info`, because
the port does not keep one module per file (`sensor_modules/camera_sm.ex` holds
`CameraSM`).

### 10.3 `/modules`: 360 classes, four columns, two filters

`ExTbpMontyWeb.ModulesLive` (route `/modules`, `Monty.ModuleMap.Table` is the
pure half): Monty class (linked at the commit the map records), Elixir module
(linked at the file the map recorded, or at the path the name promises), status,
and what stands in. Filters are URL state (`?q=…&status=…`); `q` is any words
from the row, all of which must match.

### 10.4 The finding this session ended on: our training builds **two** graphs where Monty builds **three**

The user noticed it on the charts — Monty's pyview chart shows three lines
(`new_object0..2`), ours two — and said "this experiment must have 3 objects".
The config does not:

- `conf/env_interface/test_train_2obj_predefined_eval_1obj_predefined.yaml`
  names **2 training objects** (`capsule3DSolid`, `cubeSolid`) and **1 evaluation
  object** (`capsule3DSolid`); `n_train_epochs: 3`, `n_eval_epochs: 3`, so a run
  is **6 training + 3 evaluation episodes**, which is what both runners do.
- The third line is a _graph_, not a configured object. Monty names what a
  training episode learned `"new_object" + str(len(graph_memory))`
  (`evidence_matching/learning_module.py:590`, `set_detected_object`) whenever the
  episode ends `no_match` with possible matches, or with none — so the memory
  grows by one whenever training fails to recognise what it saw.
- Monty's own rows, `~/tbp/results/monty/projects/monty_runs/test_evidence_lm_evidence_mujoco_with_liveview/train_stats.csv`
  (6 rows): results `new_object0`, `new_object0`, `new_object1`, `new_object2`,
  `new_object0`, `new_object0`, steps 21/25/22/23/25/24, evidence ≤ 5.25.
  **Three graphs.**
- Ours, six training episodes in `/tmp/port_evidence_mujoco2.log`: steps
  25/28/29/28/27/32, last belief `nothing yet`, `new_object0` ×5, evidence up to
  11.74. **Two graphs** (`new_object0`, `new_object1`).

So the open question is not the object list but **training recognition**: our
training episodes report a match against graph 0 where Monty's fail to match and
create a new graph, and our episodes run 3–8 steps longer. Two candidates, in
order of likelihood: (a) our train-mode matching concludes too readily (evidence,
`object_evidence_threshold`, or the pose-narrowing rule), and (b) our episodes
have a different ending, so the `no_match` branch that creates a graph is not
reached. Compare per episode against the CSV above — same seed (42), same config.

### 10.5 The runner's memory rule has one home

`Run.next_memories/3` is "what the next episode starts from": a training episode
hands on the graphs it built, an evaluation one hands on what it was given. Both
`Jobs.Run` and `mix monty.run` ask it. Measured on
`test/evidence_lm/evidence_mujoco`: it used to be 3 + 3 episodes with `nothing
yet` throughout and a `no_match` summary; it is now 6 + 3 with episode 2 already
seeing `new_object0 (112 hypotheses)` and a `match` summary.

### 10.6 The plan for 100 % of the map (the user's standing priority)

The bar is **0 planned classes**; today 360 classes are **176 implemented, 182
planned, 2 excluded** (the excluded two are Hydra's own tooling and stay
excluded). `mix monty.module_map.verify` prints the numbers; `/modules` shows
them with the reason for each.

Order by experiments unblocked:

1. `GraphLM` (`frameworks/models/graph_matching.py:497-1104`) — the keystone.
   Its surface is 43 methods but only eight are arithmetic:
   `_compute_possible_matches`, `_update_possible_matches`, `_update_memory`,
   `_update_target_graph_mapping`, `_agent_moved_since_reset`, `_add_displacements`,
   `_select_features_to_use`, `_add_votes_to_buffer_stats`. The rest is
   bookkeeping `EvidenceGraphLM` already expresses here, plus the LM struct's
   fields. Collaborators to check first: `FeatureAtLocationBuffer` (may not be
   written) and `GraphGoalGenerator` (ported).
2. `DisplacementGraphLM` — 62 experiments on its own.
3. `FeatureGraphLM` — 19. 4. `MontySupervisedObjectPretrainingExperiment` — 17.
4. `TwoDSensorModule` + `DefaultAttentionSystem` — 10.
5. `MontyBase`, the no-reset model, Omniglot — 8.

**The trap that decides how to sequence it**: `class_status` marks a class
`implemented` when `Code.ensure_loaded?` says its module exists. Creating
`Monty.Frameworks.Models.GraphMatching.GraphLM` on its own therefore makes the
page offer configs whose arithmetic is half written. `GraphLM` must land
**together with its first real subclass** (`DisplacementGraphLM`) and with
Monty's own `tests/unit/frameworks/models/graph_matching_test.py` translated as
the spec. The two shell classes stay `planned` on purpose — do not "implement"
them to move the counter.

### 10.7 Two questions still with the user

- Monty's pytest fixtures are in our catalogue and are not experiments
  (`test/hierarchy/monty/*`, `test/hierarchy/environment/*`, `test/run*`,
  `test/base_config/base*`, `test/profile/base*`): should the catalogue label
  them "a Monty test fixture, not an experiment", or keep refusing them?
- Is Habitat-Sim a permanent refusal, with the stand-in scene offered as the
  shape-only option? Nothing has changed here; the refusal is honest today.

## 11. The port's own computational gaps, and where they are written down

Sections 1–9 are about the app, CI, one crash and performance. The **gaps in
the port itself** are a different list and are not duplicated here — they are
kept where they are checked, so they cannot drift from the code:

| What a person needs                                                            | Where it lives                                                                                                                            |

The gaps that are genuinely open, in the order they block work:

1. **Training runs, and its numbers do not yet match Monty's.** The refusal that
   used to sit here (`:training_not_implemented`) is gone: a training phase
   carries what each episode learned into the next one, and a run writes the
   memory it built (`Memory.save/4`, `<artifacts>/<run>/memory/trained/`). What
   is open is the _science_: our training builds one graph fewer than Monty's on
   `test/evidence_lm/evidence_mujoco` (section 10.4), and nothing yet compares a
   trained memory with Monty's own. [`training.md`](training.md) §3 is where the
   persistence notes live; the comparison is section 10.4 here.
2. **Unported classes are refused, not stubbed.** `Monty.ModuleMap.StandIns`
   names the two that exist as shells (`Monty`, `MontyForGraphMatching`) and the
   MuJoCo classes the carried world implements; anything else a config names is a
   finding that says so. The table on `/modules` is the same data, generated.
3. **The motor policy disagrees with the world on a surface-agent jump** — the
   raise in section 4 (`InformedPolicy.assert_undo_jump_was_successful/2`). This
   is the one computational gap with a stack trace attached, on
   `base_10simobj_surf_agent`, after nine objects were recognised. It may be a
   real difference in how the undo is accounted for, or an assertion stricter
   than Monty's behaviour; the port's `docs/monty-differences.md` is where it
   belongs once it is understood.
4. **Config values Monty interpolates may not resolve here.** A blueprint that
   says `n_eval_epochs: ${constants.rotations_all_count}` was refused with
   `:epochs_not_a_count` — the interpolation was not applied before the value
   was validated. Check whether this is still true (`Monty.Studio.Blueprint`)
   before treating it as open; it was recorded as open point 11 and may have
   moved with the blueprint work.
5. **Votes between modules** were the cause of a `CaseClauseError` on
   `tutorial/dist_agent_5lm_2obj_eval` (open point 12). `_combine_votes` was
   ported and the ladder's eight lines did not move — verify against that
   config rather than trusting this note.

**The rule that keeps this list honest**: a computational gap must surface as a
refusal with a sentence, never as a stand-in that runs. That is what `7cba014`
established and what section 3 is trying to extend to crashes — the same
principle, applied to a process that dies instead of a class that is missing.
